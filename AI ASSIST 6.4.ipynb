        "Task 05 focused on designing a ShoppingCart class for an e-commerce system. This class included methods to add_item (with optional quantity), remove_item (handling all instances of a named item), calculate_total using a loop, and apply_discount conditionally based on a total threshold. The implementation utilized object-oriented programming, list manipulations, loops, and conditional logic to manage cart functionality and calculate the final bill, including discount application. Sample usage demonstrated adding, removing, calculating totals, and applying discounts.\n",
